Statistical Methods for Astrophysics in Crete (SMAC)

This is the repository for a weekly statistics seminar held by the astronomy group within the University of Crete Department of Physics. 

Only Rules:  
1. No experience necessary. Weekly seminars should be designed with this in mind.  
2. Seminars should be interactive and participatory.  
3. All code, plots, and data will be publicly available.
